                    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I websurfed weak and weary,<br />
                    Over many a strange and spurious website of &lsquo;hot chicks galore,&rsquo;<br />
                    While I clicked my fav&rsquo;rite bookmark, suddenly there came a warning,<br />
                    And my heart was filled with mourning, mourning for my dear amour.<br />
                    &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not possible,&rdquo; I muttered, &ldquo;give me back my cheap hardcore!&rdquo;
