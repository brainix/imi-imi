        We have to resolve a stem to a keychain for every tag whenever we index
        or unindex a bookmark.  That's why it's important that resolving a stem
        to a keychain is fast.  In Google App Engine's datastore, it's
        significantly faster to look up an object by key than to retrieve an
        object using a query.  Therefore, we use this method consistently for
        naming a new keychain as well as looking up an existing keychain by stem
        (rather than querying over the stem property).
